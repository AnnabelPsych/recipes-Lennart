## How to Contribute

### Adding a New Recipe

To add a new recipe to the repository, please follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Recipes Folder**: 
Locate the `/recipes` subfolder in the project directory.
   
2. **Create a New Recipe File**: 
Create a new `.qmd` file within the `/recipes` subfolder for your recipe. 
To simplify this process, you can copy an existing recipe file as a template or use the [`template.qmd` file](recipes/template.qmd) as a starting point.

3. **Add Your Recipe**:
Populate the new `.qmd` file with your recipe details.
Make sure to follow the formatting and structure of the existing recipes for consistency.

4. **Commit Your Changes**: 
Once you've added your recipe, commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. 
For example:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new recipe for [Recipe Name]"
   ```
